# Some sort of Lisp

Author: Lucas S. Vieira <lucasvieira@pm.me>

## Description

This is some sort of Lisp environment built from scratch in C in my spare time.
I don't know where this will take me, though.

This is mostly inspired by the book Interpreting LISP by Gary D. Knott, though
I might add a few tweaks of my own, of course.
